## DevOps tool chain i have used 

# I have implemented whole  pipeline  which includes the following :
1. Using a ​ source control management​ tool - like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc
2. Testing​ - test your code using either JUnit, Selenium, PyUnit and many more
3. Build​ - build your code using tool like Maven, Gradle, Ant and many more
4. Continuous Integration​ - Continuous integrate your code using tool like Jenkins,
GitLab CLI, Travis CLI, and many more
5. Containerize​ - Containerize your code using Docker.
6. Push your created Docker image to ​ Docker hub​.
7. Deployment​ - Do configuration management and deployment using either Chef,
Puppet, Ansible, Rundeck. Using these do configuration management and pull your
docker image and run it on the managed hosts.
8. For Deployment you can either do it on your ​ local machine​ or on Kubernetes cluster
or OpenStack cloud. You can also use Amazon AWS or Google Cloud or some other
3rd party cloud.
9. Monitoring​ - for monitoring use the ELK stack. Use a log file to do the monitoring.
Generate the log file for your mini project and pass in your ELK stack.
